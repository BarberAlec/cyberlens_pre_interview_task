This project was completed as a pre-\/interview task for \href{https://www.cyberlens.eu/}{\texttt{ cyberlens}}. It simulates the processing of packets via multiple consumer threads. Each consumer thread accepts a packet in the form of a vector of strings from the producer. Each consumer continually check for meta commands from its producer. These commands are either E\+ND or R\+E\+P\+O\+RT. The consumer can perform these actions before completing all tasks on the job queue.\hypertarget{index_Shortcomings}{}\doxysection{Shortcomings}\label{index_Shortcomings}
Their are a number of items which I feel could have had a better solutions, many with T\+O\+DO comments within the code.\hypertarget{index_requirements}{}\doxysection{requirements}\label{index_requirements}
