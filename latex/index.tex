\hypertarget{index_intro}{}\doxysection{Project Description}\label{index_intro}
This project was completed as a pre-\/interview task for \href{https://www.cyberlens.eu/}{\texttt{ cyberlens}}. It simulates the processing of packets via multiple consumer threads.

The program is initiated via the instantiation of a \mbox{\hyperlink{classProducer}{Producer}} object. The \mbox{\hyperlink{classProducer}{Producer}} object constructs three \mbox{\hyperlink{classConsumer}{Consumer}} objects and begins their operation in a new thread (begin\+\_\+thread()). Each consumer thread continually searches both their personal job and command queues for new tasks and \mbox{\hyperlink{classProducer}{Producer}} commands respectively.

There are two forms of commands that the \mbox{\hyperlink{classProducer}{Producer}} can send in the command queue. The first is a R\+E\+P\+O\+RT command which asks the \mbox{\hyperlink{classConsumer}{Consumer}} to generate and print(to file) a report of all packets thus far processed. The second command is an E\+ND command which asks the consumer to cease searching for new jobs/tasks. The E\+ND command is always followed by a join call from the \mbox{\hyperlink{classProducer}{Producer}} thread.

With regards to packet processing, the consumer accepts packets in the form of a vector of strings (typedefined as csv\+\_\+row). Once received, the consumer creates a new unique\+\_\+packet object and performs a comparison check against all packets previously received to check for a duplicate. If a duplicate is found, the count and index of the original packet \textquotesingle{}unique\+\_\+packet\textquotesingle{} is updated. If no duplicate is found, a new entry is made. One element that can be certainly improved upon is how the unique\+\_\+packets are stored. Currently a vector is used. This is not ideal as with increasing numbers of unique\+\_\+packets, the problem of checking to see if the next packet is unique becomes harder. Depending on memory restrictions, a solution could be the creation of a smart hashing function and associated hash map.

Both commands and jobs are passed from the \mbox{\hyperlink{classProducer}{Producer}} to the \mbox{\hyperlink{classConsumer}{Consumer}} via a \mbox{\hyperlink{classSharedQueue}{Shared\+Queue}} object. \mbox{\hyperlink{classSharedQueue}{Shared\+Queue}} is a wrapper for a stanard queue and aims to make access to the queue safe. This is achieved for a mutex which is assigned to it via the \mbox{\hyperlink{classProducer}{Producer}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{classConsumer}{Consumer}}.\hypertarget{index_requirements}{}\doxysection{requirements}\label{index_requirements}
